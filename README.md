# 📌 Restroly FrontEnd

FrontEnd web application for **Restroly** — a QR-based restaurant menu and contactless ordering experience.
This project provides the user interface for browsing menus, selecting items, and placing orders — connecting seamlessly with the Restroly backend.

Restroly enables restaurants and hotels to offer digital menus and order placement by scanning QR codes placed at tables or rooms. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:
- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher
- **npm** 9.0 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**
- **Code Editor** (VS Code recommended)

---

### 📌 Getting Started

#### 1. Navigate to Frontend Directory
From the root of the cloned `RestroHub` repository, enter the frontend directory:
```bash
cd RestroHub-FrontEnd
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the frontend root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and enter your actual config values:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8181/restroly` (Should point to your Spring Boot backend)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID (Must match the one configured on the backend)

---

### 📌 Run Locally

To launch the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, Vite will start the frontend on port **3000**:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🌐 Backend Integration

The frontend app automatically integrates with the **Restroly backend API** to load menus, categories, handle orders, and perform authentication.

The API client configuration can be found at `src/services/common/api.js`. It is set up to automatically look at `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from your `.env` file, falling back to `http://localhost:8181/restroly` when not specified.

---

## 🧠 Features in UI

### 📋 Menu & Categories

* View all menus
* Filter by category
* Search food items

### 🛒 Cart & Order

* Add / remove items from cart
* View cart summary
* Place orders using backend APIs

> Expand features as needed: Authentication, user profiles, order history, live order tracking.

---

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy this frontend to:

✔ Vercel
✔ Netlify
✔ GitHub Pages
✔ AWS Amplify
✔ Firebase Hosting

Example (Netlify):

```bash
npm run build
# then deploy the build folder
npm run deploy

```

---

## 🧩 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root (Vite only exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_`):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8181/restroly
# Google OAuth: create credentials in Google Cloud Console and set your client id here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here
```

How to obtain a Google Client ID:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Create or select a project
3. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID" and choose "Web application"
4. Add `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite dev URL) to Authorized JavaScript origins
5. Copy the `Client ID` and add it to your `.env` as `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

After updating `.env`, restart the dev server.

## 🛎️ Real-Time Customer Service Request Layer (Issue #120)

We have successfully integrated a complete, E2E real-time "Call Waiter / Request Bill" service interaction layer across the entire stack.

### Key Capabilities

* **Customer Floating "Service" FAB:** Adds a modern, floating interactive menu on the customer menu view (`/Restrohub/:restaurantName/:branchId?table=X`), allowing diners to instantly request table services:
  * 🔔 **Call Waiter**
  * 💳 **Request Bill**
* **Admin-Configured Feature Flags:** Toggled directly by restaurant owners from the **Restaurant Settings UI** (Profile → Restaurant Info). Modifying the feature toggle updates settings via `PUT /secure/api/v1/restaurants/{id}` to automatically show/hide the button E2E.
* **Instant WebSocket Pushes:** Built on top of a reusable and generic notification module using STOMP WebSockets, instantly notifying the Admin Dashboard bell icon with the exact generating table details (e.g., `"Call Waiter — Table 5"`).
* **Smart Anti-Spam Protections:** Enforces a 30-second submission cooldown timer per table to prevent notification floods on the staff dashboard.
* **Counter QR Safety:** Automatically suppresses and hides the FAB if the scanned QR code corresponds to Table `0` (the main counter QR code).
